Hi guys, good morning. Everyone good morning, so we have a new requirement coming up on this as WV project and we need some developers on the Sprint, which are made for is WB so I would be removing some developers from the current spring and switching them to the edge, WB Sprint.
So I am adding under again.
Caution to the Sprint.
For SWP.

Just to add up on that Neville you might not be there last week, but prod deployment. Just field so we're still looking into the cost. The rollback was successful. However, the business user were not satisfied so should we keep this as a first priority or should we go for the regulatory project.
OK, I will have to ask Prashanth about it, I will get back to you and rock can. We just check with that can he help us and testing out the cases, which might have caused the issue.
As far as the last testing was concerned it was, it past successful be. But we need to look at the issue probability there might be some configuration issues, which might be causing it.
OK, cool. I have to check on it with press on.
Another thing is the month and is coming in. We need to fill all our time just by 25th of May.
Will this have a different you know project code or something against? Which we need to fill out timesheets also.
Yeah, I will get back to you guys, I will mail the project code to you.
But can we also pull up weather in our projects. Becaus regulated project seems quite important, and we don't want to miss out on the deadlines. Yeah, sure we definitely need more developers on it. So where they can join.
Yeah, cool.
Thank you room.
Thanks man.
