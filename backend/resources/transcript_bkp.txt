N:Hi Guys, good morning everyone
V:Hey Hi good morning
N:So we have a new requirement coming up on this SWP project and we need some developers on sprint made for SWP.So I would be reallocating some developers from the current sprint to SWP project sprint. So I am adding Anurag and Kaushik to the sprint for SWP.
A:Hi Nehal, you might not know as you weren't there last week, we had a pod deployment failure. They are still looking into the cause. The rollback was successful however the business users were not satisfied. So do we need to keep this as a first priority or should we go for the regulatory project of SWP. 
N: I will need to ask Prashant about it and will get back to you.
P: Can we just check with Praphul that can we have some something that can enable to figure oout the cause of the failure.
S: All the test cases were successful, none the defects were deferred.I think we have some configuration issues between UAT and PROD which might have caused. I think it will take around 2 hours.
N: Ok Cool
A: Another thing is that the month end is coming and we need to fill our timesheet by end of May.
P: I have a question, do we have a separate project code for this new SWP project against which we need to fill our timesheet, or so.
N: Yeah, I will get back to you guys and will mail the project code to you. 
A: Can we have Vaidehi on this project as we don't want to miss any deadline
N:  Yes sure, we definitely need more developers on this project, Vaidehi can join the project. 
V: I have bandwidth and can definitely join.
N: ok cool, thank you everyone.
V: Thank you.
